# React-Native
Generally speaking, it is a framework for building native apps using React, which is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
`React-Native` allows to use React and native capabilities in the same time. We can build application for Android, iOS.
But we must remember that not all features are available on every platform. Everything has its limits.
`React-Native` works by using `bridges` to translate JavaScript into native components.
For example alert window looks different on Android and on iOS. The code is mostly shared for both platforms.
