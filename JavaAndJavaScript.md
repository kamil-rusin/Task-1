# Java vs JavaScript

In my opinion, it is not the same thing. As someone mentioned on the internet, they are only connected by `Java` word.
They are not in the same category of programming languages.
- The first major difference between them is that `Java` is a compiled and statically typed language, while `JavaScript` is a scripting and dynamically typed language.
- `Java` applications are run in Java Virtual Machine and it requires installing JDK and JRE on a system.
- `JavaScript` applications are run on a web browser, so they don't need any initial setup. 
- `JavaScript` is considered prototype based language. It means that we are not bound to code patterns like in `Java`. However `JavaScript` allows to use for example similar class construction.
- `JavaScript` applications can be built faster, but the bigger the app gets, the more effort into upkeep is needed.
